# ùÑ° Bach CoCoCo

#### Collaborative Convolutional Counterpoint

Bach CoCoCo is an experimental user interface to collaboratively compose counterpoint with an AI agent trained on the chorale canon of the eminent JS Bach. The repo uses a modified tensorflow.js implementation of [Coconet](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/coconet) by Huang et. al, with a soft-prior-based strategy for tuning the output of the neural network.
